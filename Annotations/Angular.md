# Angular

Angular was created by Google
It's first version was based on JS
But it was totally rewrite to use TS and known as Angular 2 and the old version named AngularJS

### Property Binding

Helps to set in HTML properties the component properties values

When i have a html property i can use in that way:

```js
[value] = "myComponentProperty";
```

If i don't, i can use in that another way:

```html
<p>The value of the component property is: {{"myComponentProperty}}</p>
```
